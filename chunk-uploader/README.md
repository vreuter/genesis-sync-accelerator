# Chunk Uploader

A background service that monitors a Cardano node's ImmutableDB directory for completed chunks and uploads them to S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, etc.). It is the companion to the Genesis Sync Accelerator, populating the CDN that the accelerator serves from.

## Usage

```
chunk-uploader --immutable-dir PATH --s3-bucket BUCKET [OPTIONS]
```

AWS credentials are read from the standard environment variables / credential chain.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--immutable-dir PATH` | *(required)* | ImmutableDB `immutable/` directory to watch |
| `--s3-bucket BUCKET` | *(required)* | S3 bucket name |
| `--s3-prefix PREFIX` | `immutable/` | Key prefix for uploaded objects |
| `--s3-endpoint URL` | *(none)* | Custom S3 endpoint (`scheme://host[:port]`) for R2, MinIO, etc. |
| `--s3-region REGION` | `us-east-1` | AWS region |
| `--poll-interval SECONDS` | `10` | How often to check for new chunks |
| `--state-file PATH` | `<immutable-dir>/.chunk-uploader-state` | Upload progress state file |

## How it works

1. Polls the immutable directory for completed chunks. A chunk is considered complete when the *next* chunk's `.chunk` file exists, confirming the current one is finalized.
2. Uploads each completed chunk's three files (`.chunk`, `.primary`, `.secondary`) to the configured S3 bucket.
3. Records the last successfully uploaded chunk number in a state file so it can resume without re-uploading.
4. Retries failed uploads with exponential backoff.
